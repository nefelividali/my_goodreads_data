After reading the reviews, I braced myself for a dark but interesting story that portrays BDSM relationships in a less than favourable -perhaps even harmful- light, as is so often the case.<br/><br/>Well, I just finished the book (in one sitting, might I add) and these are my somewhat scattered thoughts:<br/><br/>A lot of reviewers are angry about the fact that there's no consent ever asked for or being given at any point at all during the entire thing. And that's a totally valid reason to be angry if you're going into it thinking that it's a sort of romantic drama or, as the <i>so very helpful</i> GR tags say, just a contemporary piece of fiction. But I don't think this is what this is? <br/><br/>Like, this is the first (and hopefully only) time in my life where I'll have the obnoxiousness to say: ""I think you read this wrong"".<br/><br/>The relationship in the book isn't supposed to be healthy and liberating, it's supposed to be horryfying. And I don't understand why the tag is hidden after a bunch of others in the description of the book, but this is a <i>horror</i> story. In the vein of Ogawa's other horror stories, like [b:Revenge|16032127|Revenge|Yōko Ogawa|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349818757l/16032127._SY75_.jpg|6316882] and [b:The Diving Pool|1337973|The Diving Pool  Three Novellas|Yōko Ogawa|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317064652l/1337973._SX50_.jpg|2542259]. A very subtle, very fascinating, very well-written and very effective horror story. This is not to say that you should <i>like</i> it, that's entirely besides the point, you can dislike it for a million reasons and that's absolutely fine. But I think that it does mean that you should probably shift your perspective and judge it through a different lens than you would a book like <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> or whatever infuriatingly wrongful representations of BDSM relationships in books are out there.<br/><br/>This is in no way, shape or form a relationship that the reader is supposed to be <i>rooting</i> for. The Translator isn't supposed to be a character that you secretly want to fuck (maybe you do, but that's not the point). I spent the entirety of the book scared about whether Mari will even make it out of this situation alive. That's horror!<br/><br/>Anyway, these are my two cents about <i>Hotel Iris</i> and I only felt compelled to write a review at 1 in the morning because I think that Ogawa is a marvelous writer and a lot of reviews are doing her a disservice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>P.S. One more thing that's neither here nor there: I believe that authors do have a certain degree of responsibility towards their readers, but I also believe that exploring lack-of-consent or other otherwise fucked up in real-life scenarios in fiction is okay. This exploration is, among other things, what fiction is for. That is all.",,,1,0

No, my problem was George, the main character. The story is written in the first person from her point of view, so you can read her thoughts throughout the book. And most of those thoughts are variations of ""I'm not like other girls"". You see, while other girls think too much about what to wear or how to style their hair, George thinks about guns and motorcycles and journalism. She is different, she is not a bimbo, she is a modern warrior. Unlike other girls. This is important, other girls are NOT like that, but George IS, and she really wants you to know it.<br/><br/>Maybe I wouldn't have that much of a problem with this, but I was first introduced to Mira Grant with <i> Rolling in the Deep </i> and <i> Into the Drowning Deep </i> and the women in those books are so insanely awesome while George just seems like an annoying teenager.",,,1,0

You pick up one of her books in the morning, read for (what you think is) about an hour, and then suddenly it's night-time and you've finished the book and you have no idea how many hours have actually passed. It's mind-boggling, really. <br/>It's not the fact that she's exceptionally eloquent or that the stories she makes up are extremely interesting (although both of these things are, in most cases, true). It's that her writing has a remarkable <i>flow</i>. I have never read anything by another author that gave me the feeling I get from reading Butler's works -even ones that I can't say I particularly liked, like <i>Fledgling</i>.<br/><br/>Angela Carter, for instance, is an excellent writer on a technical level; her prose is scintillating. Ursula LeGuin is absolutely brilliant in worldbuilding. But when I read either of them, I am perfectly aware of the time that passes. I immensely enjoy their work, but reading their books makes me feel like... well, like I'm reading. <br/>Butler makes me feel like I'm somehow <i>in</i> the story. When I read <i>Kindred</i> I got so immersed that I wasn't even aware that I started crying at some point. But I must have because, by the end, my eyes were damp and I had a runny nose.<br/><br/>Butler's writing is mesmerizing, but it's not the only thing that makes me love her so. <i>Dawn</i> is a gripping, fascinating story that uses aliens as a means in order to study the human condition. The results of the study aren't at all hopeful, but it makes you think and it makes you feel. Sometimes it also makes you cry. And what more can you ask of a book, really?",,,1,0

I liked the gradual reveal about the protagonists' pasts but there wasn't really any character development to speak of. Therefore, my enjoyment of the book relied mostly on the premise, which wasn't particularly original, and the action, which was fairly well done.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that I didn't like the book, because Ι did, a lot. I read it in one sitting and didn't even realise that any time had passed. I enjoyed the fact that this wasn't your typical Good vs. Bad story, since almost everyone is, as the title of the series suggests, a villain. I also appreciated the thought that went into how EO's are born (or reborn, as it were).<br/><br/>So yeah, all in all a really pleasant experience, I'm definitely reading the sequel.

I know, a Native American witch!""</spoiler><br/><br/><b><u>The slightly annoying</u></b><br/>I know I'm being nitpicky and I swear, these things wouldn't bother me much if I didn't have other, major issues with the book, but now I started and I can't stop. Katherine goes to the bookshop to ask about Sarah and the bookseller tells her: ""They say there are missing journal pages out there somewhere."" A page and a half later, Katherine says ""It says in the book there were lost pages, the ones she was working on just before her death. Were they ever found?"" Are you not paying any attention?? He just TOLD you that they say there are missing pages and it's obvious that he doesn't know anything about that. Why are you even in this book??<br/><br/>Well, writing the review helped and it has become pretty apparent that this started as a 4-star read and gradually became worse. So 2 it is.",,,1,0

Well, I didn't like Yalom, that is. I found most of his chapters/write-ups a chore to read and often rolled my eyes, whereas Ginny's words flow beautifuly and I couldn't help but relate a lot to some of her struggles.<br/><br/>It's a book written in the '70s, about therapy sessions done in the '70s and there is a lot of preoccupation with gender roles and a lot of casual racism even as early as the introduction (where Yalom, upon meeting Ginny, informs us that ""<i>I could not walk slowly enough; like an Oriental wife she followed a few noiseless steps behind</i>""). So the experience of reading it was not exactly pleasant.<br/><br/>I have no doubt (and, in fact, it becomes very clear as you read on) that Ginny was tremendously helped by these sessions. But I couldn't help but think how much more hepful it would have been for her to thave a therapist that is more conscious about how the world works outside of her own self -that is to say, a therapist that acknowledges that some of Ginny's problems, while stemming from within, are exceedingly heightened within the framework of a patriarchal society.",,,1,0

Fertility is an expression of health, not a disease to be treated with a drug.</i>""</blockquote><br/>It is true that the pill often has extreme side effects about which no one warns you and that it's prescribed too easily as a way to ignore people when they justifiably complain about having irregular periods, menstrual cramps, bad PMS, or acne. That's all good and well and we should definitely have a open discussion about what the pill is and what it does and what possible consequences it might have to our health, both physical and mental. We should have an open discussion about periods, period (hah, get it?)<br/><br/>But the way Briden keeps talking about hormonal contraception throughout the book makes it seem like she believes it's the <i>devil personified</i>. I had a bad experience with the pill and I know lots of people who went through the same things. But I also know a bunch of people for whom the pill <i>works</i> and that's marvelous for them and I hope it keeps helping them forever and ever and who is Briden to tell them to stop taking it (because she does, multiple times).<br/><br/>Anyway, other than the fearmongering concerning the pill and other types of hormonal contraception, I found some of her advice lacking, to say the least:<br/><blockquote>""<i>Need a quick way to know if a food item has too much sugar? Ask yourself: ‘Does it taste really sweet?’ If it does—if it is essentially dessert—then it has too much sugar.</i>""</blockquote><br/>Uuhh... thanks?<br/><br/>Lastly, the structure of the book is a dumpster fire. Briden asks you not to skim but to read every section carefully and, after a certain point, that's almost impossible to do because of all the repetition. It feels like I read 200 pages that said ""Don't eat sugar. Don't eat wheat. Don't eat cow dairy. Don't drink alcohol. Make sure you get enough magnesium, zinc and vitamin B6. Ask your doctor to make a bunch of blood test to judge whether you have a deficiency in those and then take supplements. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T YOU DARE TAKE HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION IT WILL RUIN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND YOUR BODY AND KILL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY, IT WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING YOU LOVE"" (Actual summary)<br/><br/>And I feel that my meanness is justifiable.",,,1,0

It is a book that analyzes a few well-known games and gives you the strategies you need to follow in order to win.<br/><br/><i>MONOPOLY<br/>Much like in real capitalism, success is a mixture of luck, judgment, and the extent of one's willingness to mercilessly crush the weak.</i><br/><br/>You can't really argue with that, can you?<br/>It also explains how these well-known games usually end.<br/><br/><i>TIC-TAC-TOE<br/>In an unsatisfying impasse. If it doesn't end in an unsatisfying impasse then one of two things has happened.<br/>1. You lost -in which case it seems doubtful you are competent enough to read this.<br/>2. Your opponent lost -in which case hopefully they are not someone you consider a good friend and/or your intellectual equal.</i><br/><br/><i>CHARADES<br/>It ends when either the booze runs out, the guests pass out, or you stop explaining to anyone who will listen that ""It was clearly a bloody madeleine. Go on then, you show me how you'd do a madeleine. I thought not. That's a terrible madeleine.""</i><br/><br/><i>ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS<br/>Normally with the loser saying, ""Best of seven?""</i><br/><br/><i>HANGMAN<br/>(Literacy education for children -using the wholesome medium of capital punishment.)<br/>It ends with a stick man swinging from the gallows, as the losing player insists he still needs a face, ears, and shoes to be drawn on. And maybe an umbrella.</i><br/><br/><i>SCRABBLE<br/>With a polite impasse (11 points, plus 50 for using all seven tiles) about whether or not od is a word, precipitating a somewhat socially strained visit to the bookshelf for a dictionary, which is then slammed shut with a ""Fine, tell me what it means then."" The answer, not that it matters, is: ""a hypothetical and omnipresent natural force.""</i><br/><br/>If there are games in here that you don't actually know how to play, don't worry; everything is explained.<br/><br/><i>STONE SKIPPING<br/>Carefully select a rock. Throw the rock. Watch it bounce once then crash into the waves. Blame the rock.</i><br/><br/><br/>Aside from all this, the book does actually give you advice on how to win those games. So, if you want to read this because it seems funny, go ahead; it is. But if you want to read it because you genuinely want to win at everything, including pillow fights and thumb wrestling, maybe you should think about getting some professional help.",,,1,0

For goodness’ sake. We had a tiny bit of a disagreement over the champagne yesterday, in the vintner’s. Twelve bottles of Dom Pérignon: over a grand’s worth of champagne. ‘Why couldn’t you just have got Moët,’ I asked him, ‘like a normal person?’<br/>‘Because you would have complained. Last time you told me it gave you a headache, because of “all the sugar” added in the standard brands. Only the finest stuff for Miranda Adams.’<br/>As I expected, the woman, Heather, isn’t drinking it. She’s taken one tiny sip, to be polite, and put it back down on the tray. I imagine she thinks it’s unprofessional to have more than that, and she’s right. So, thanks to Julien’s ‘generosity’ we’re going to be left with a wasted glass, tainted by this stranger’s spit.</i></blockquote><br/>Delightful, delightful people.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>I glance over to where poor Katie, across the table from me, is seated next to the Icelandic man with the strange eyes, who seems to have taken a bit of a shine to her. It’s a bloody nightmare, them being here too. Are we going to have to share the sauna with them? Judging by the state of the clothes they’re wearing I’d have to disinfect myself afterwards.</i></blockquote><br/>Ew, poor people, am I right?<br/><br/>Anyway, Posh Twat No. 1 ends up murdered but we don't actually find out who they are until the very end of the book, right around the time we find out who their murderer, Posh Twat No. 2, is.<br/><br/>The book is slow, alternating between the present (after the murder) and the past (a couple of days before the murder), presumably in order to build tension? I'm afraid it fails.<br/><br/>The characters are unbelievably unlikeable. This is almost certainly done on purpose and it would be a great choice if they all ended up dead but, unfortunately, they don't. I'm serious, they have <i>no</i> redeeming qualities whatsoever. They're terrible people. They're supposed to be old friends from university (Oxford, of course, of course) but they don't seem to actually like each other at all. Their behaviour towards each other is passive-aggressive at the best of times and downright hostile at the worst. They constantly act like spoiled children. And look, I get it, some of them have troubled pasts but, come on, they're in their 30's. Most of us have some kind of troubled childhood but, after a certain point, that has to stop being used as an excuse. You're a grownup, get your shit together.<br/><br/>If I had to say one good thing about the book it would probably be that I didn't guess who the murderer was. Of course, one might argue that we don't even know who the victim is, so how on earth can we guess the killer? That's a fair question, it <i>does</i> feel a little bit like Foley is trying to cheat.<br/><br/>Another good thing is that the whole time I was reading this I kept imagining the guests as members of the Bluth family from <i>Arrested Develpment</i> and I had a <i>lot</i> of fun.<br/><br/><img src=""https://assets.nerdwallet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/anigif_enhanced-buzz-13484-1349223560-2.gif"" width=""400"" height=""250"" alt=""description""/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You can find my review here:<br/>https://tokillamockingjay.home.blog/2019/06/19/the-hunting-party-by-lucy-foley/",,,1,0

But from the minute that Ed and I first spoke at that party six months ago (just six months!), I've felt both strengthened and weakened at the same time.</i></b></blockquote><br/>If you were really content with your own company, then you wouldn't have agreed to marry a man you barely know after two dates.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>'Ta.'

One of those do-gooders who feel it's their duty to befriend the wicked?</i></b></blockquote><br/>What? How... What do you mean? He simply asked if you're visiting someone in prison. Which you are. As his lawyer. You don't have to be a do-gooder who 'befriends the wicked' in order to visit someone in prison. <br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>Three men are waiting, as if loitering on a street. They all stare. A fourth man is busy cleaning out a goldfish tank, his back to us. It strikes me as being incongruous -murderers looking after goldfish?</i></b></blockquote><br/>Okay, first of all, you don't know that he's a murderer. Second of all, why can't murderers look after goldfish?? <br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>I'm growing impatient. 'So what exactly do you want to base your appeal on?'<br/>'You've passed the first test. Now you've got to pass the second. Then you'll know.'</i></b></blockquote><br/>Are you serious? What kind of lawyer lets their client play games with them? Listen, mister, you're in prison, you either tell me what you want to base your appeal on or you just stay in here for the rest of your life.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>Ed's hand grips mine so hard that it hurts. Then he releases me and moves away. 'Lily's got a headache.'<br/>No, I haven't, I almost say.<br/>[...]<br/>I stand back, shocked. Despite his ups and downs, Ed has never shouted at me before.</i></b></blockquote><br/>The guy asked you to marry him on your second date, you've been married to him for a month and now you're shocked that the way he behaves makes you feel like you don't know him at all??<br/>Also, yeah, Ed is a bucket of dicks.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>Carla eyed her reflection in the bus driver's mirror as she and Mama got on. She would always feel different because of her olive skin, her black hair, and her eyebrows, which were thicker than anyone else's.</i></b></blockquote><br/>Okay, look.

What? I'm just being polite!<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>'Why couldn't you just have told me about the boiler figures at the start? It would have saved a lot of time.'<br/>'I told you before. I had to set you the clues to see if you were bright enough to handle my case. I must have someone who's on my level for this. Someone on the ball.'</i></b></blockquote><br/>Seriously, this is beyond ridiculous.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>It reminds me of the Italian child with her thick black curls and eyebrows that belong, surely, to a teenager rather than a nine-year-old.</i></b></blockquote><br/>What? What's the difference between the eyebrows of a child and those of a teenager?<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>That's right. We've started having dinner in front of the television: something Ed's mother certainly wouldn't approve of.</i></b></blockquote><br/>Ed's mother sounds like a posh twat. <br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>There was a sigh. 'Davina is going round telling everyone that she had a drink with Ed last Tuesday. I'm sure it's nothing. Look, maybe I shouldn't have said anything. But if I were you, I'd do something about it.'<br/>'What?' My voice came out like a croak.<br/>'Have her to dinner this very week. Have lots of people to dinner. Show her you're a couple.'</i></b></blockquote><br/>These people are supposed to be <i>adults</i>. <br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>'I'm fat!' I almost spit out the words.<br/>'No. You have the shape of a woman. A proper woman.'</i></b></blockquote><br/>Shut up, Ed, you don't get to decide what a 'proper' woman looks like.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>Meanwhile, she and Mama had to get an earlier bus because it meant Mama could get to work before anyone else and borrow some of the new lipsticks to 'try out at home'.</i></b></blockquote><br/>Sure, take the only Italian character and make her a thief, that's not racist at all.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>As we go out of the room, I shoot Joe an 'I'm sorry' look. I can't help it. His reaction to the note has helped to convince me once and for all that he's innocent. You can't fake that kind of thing.</i></b></blockquote><br/>Narrator from Arrested Development: But you can. And he did.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>It seems to me that I stain whoever I try to love. Daniel, Daniel's horse, Ed... Who is next?</i></b></blockquote><br/>Are you telling me that in all your life you've only loved your husband, your brother and a horse?<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>I told Dad to be careful about security after the note. Yet here he is, still leaving the key in its usual place. Where anyone can get it. In the morning, I'll talk to him, I tell myself as I get into bed.</i></b></blockquote><br/>Okay, so you're scared. Yet here you are, leaving your dad to leave the key in its usual place. Where anyone can get it. You idiot.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>'I'm trying to tell you. The trust. They all have to get married by the age of thirty and stay married for at least five years or they won't get their inheritance.'</i></b></blockquote><br/>So this is the reason Ed proposed to Lily so fast. <br/>Come on, are you kidding me??<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>A man's future is at stake. Such responsibility!</i></b></blockquote><br/><blockquote><img src=""https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/013/564/doge.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""200"" alt=""description""/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>'Can you describe your new neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Jones?' Tony asks.<br/>The young man sighs audibly. 'Difficult. We complained about the noise of their television. First to them, but when they ignored us, we wrote to the council, but nothing's changed. It's become completely unbearable. We've put in for another place.'<br/>'Would you believe their claims of hearing screaming from the deceased's home?'<br/>'Frankly, I'd be surprised if they could hear anything above the sound of their television.'<br/>I knew Tony was good. But not this good.</i></b></blockquote><br/>Seriously? If anything, shouldn't the fact that you could hear the TV through the walls actually <i>prove</i> that you could definitely hear screams through the walls? Are you freaking kidding me?<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>Coincidences are one of those things which sound contrived until they happen in real life.</i></b></blockquote><br/>Okay, but this isn't real life, it's a book. And the coincidences <i>are</i> contrived. And lazy.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>A decision has to be made. One way or the other. A coin. Daniel used to toss a coin when he didn't know what to do. I pick up a magazine that I've left by the side of the bath. If I open on a page with an odd number, I'll leave. If it's even, I'll stay.</i></b></blockquote><br/>Okay, but this is a magazine. No matter where you open it there's going to be two pages, the left one and the right one. One odd-numbered and one even-numbered. How will this even work??<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>Now he's at home during the day, he's started doing the housework while searching for a new job -something I'm sure his traditional parents would be shocked at. He doesn't do it as well as I would, but I appreciate the gesture.</i></b></blockquote><br/>Yes, let's give him an award for doing housework in his <i>own fucking house</i>. Let's give him <i>all</i> the awards!<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>'You did it, didn't you? You did kill Sarah. You murdered your girlfriend.'<br/>Joe's eyes grow hard. 'Be careful what you say.'<br/>'But you did.' My instinct is certain.</i></b></blockquote><br/>Yeah, well your instinct was certain that he <i>didn't</i> do it a few pages ago, so what if you maybe stopped trusting it?<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>His grip os tight. Is it threatening or reassuring? I'm no longer sure. With a sinking heart, I wonder whether everything I thought I knew about this man is false.</i></b></blockquote><br/>You mean the man you tricked you into thinking that he didn't <i>murder</i> his girlfriend, when he did? Yeah, maybe everything you thought you knew about him <i>was</i> false. Who would have thought?<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>Tom's behaviour began to get more extreme. He asked one of the other mothers why she had a 'hairy moustache'. (Plain speaking can be another Asperger syndrome trait.) </i></b></blockquote><br/>Yeah, also a trait that almost every single child in the world shares. No child has a <i>filter</i>, don't blame Asperger's for that.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>Tom had been allowed to go to the local school, despite his special needs; partly because of our local connections, and partly because we'd argued that we wanted him to be in mainstream schooling. If he was with others 'like him', Ed had argued, Tom wouldn't have any role models to help him improve.</i></b></blockquote><br/>Oh, fuck you, both of you. The reason you wanted your kid to go to a mainstream school was that you didn't want to deal with the fact that he's different.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>Besides, who wants an unfaithful husband? Good-quality wine glasses are far more useful.</i></b></blockquote><br/>I actually agree with this.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>So a wedding it had been. A small one, at her insistence. Just the ad two witnesses off the street.</i></b></blockquote><br/>What do you mean 'off the street'? Like, complete strangers who happened to be outside and had nothing better to do than marry two people they've never met??<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>Her grandmother was weeping too. In the background, she could hear deep howls of male grief.</i></b></blockquote><br/>What the fuck is <i>male</i> grief? I wasn't aware that grief had a gender.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>'Never mind,' said the nurse. 'If you ask me, Poppy got what she needed. A cuddle from her mummy. Of course, the doctors would say it was their skills that sorted out those lungs of hers. But there's a lot to be said for love.'</i></b></blockquote><br/>Yeah, I'm sure the doctors with all their degrees would be <i>thrilled</i> to hear your opinion that love is literally medicine.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Okay, this was <i>way</i> more tiring than I expected. And the funny thing is that I'm not actually done. <br/>But I'll stop. I'm sure you get the point.",,,1,0

If anyone comes up to me and tells me that they thought it's simply fine, or even terrible, I won't object. <br/>I think I enjoyed it in the same way that a lot of people seemed to enjoy <i> Ready Player One</i>, that is, waving aside the parts that are arguably problematic and only keeping the ones that make them feel warm and fuzzy and nostalgic. I think I did the same thing with <i>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.</i><br/><br/>Like <i>Ready Player One,</i> this story is about a young fellow that somehow finds himself in the middle of a mystery/mission that he, of course, wants to solve.<br/>Unlike <i>Ready Player One,</i> the young protagonist of this book is not an obnoxious asshole, but actually a quite likeable character (I kept imagining him as Tom Holland, that's the level of likeable-ness I'm talking about here). <br/><br/>Like <i>Ready Player One</i>, this book features a very smart young woman who also wants to solve the mystery and mainly serves as the young man's love interest.<br/>Unlike <i>Ready Player One</i>, she has an actual personality and isn't a prize to be won at the end of the book.<br/><br/>Like <i>Ready Player One</i>, I wouldn't be shocked if I found out that this book was written by a teenage boy.<br/>Unlike <i>Ready Player One</i>, the writing here is not horrible. <br/><br/>Like <i>Ready Player One</i>, you do get a subtle feeling of nostalgia here but it is actually quite vague. You're not that sure what you're supposed to be feeling nostalgic about. <br/>Unlike <i>Ready Player One</i>, this isn't nostalgia porn. The author is not trying to shove information down your throat with meaningless references to obscure stuff, followed by an explanation of what said stuff actually is. <br/><i>Mr. Penumbra.s 24-Hour Bookstore</i> seems to know and respect the intelligence of its audience.<br/><br/>I think most people that love books and codes and puzzles and mysteries and geeky stuff are going to like this book. Maybe not love it, but definitely like it. Although I did love it. But if I'm being honest, I have no legitimate justification of why I did. I just know that I felt pure joy reading it.<br/><br/>In conclusion:<br/>Imagine a combination of <i>Ready Player One</i> and every Dan Brown book, but make it GOOD. If that appeals to you, go read <i>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</i> immediately.<br/><br/><br/>(Re-reading this review for typos etc, I realize that perhaps the only reason I actually wrote it is the opportunity to dis <i>Ready Player One</i> again. Man, I hated that book.)",,,1,0

It was mainly a mystery that dealt, among other things, with a historical matter while introducing a paranormal element as well. (The paranormal element is a ghost. There's a ghost in the book. But it's not really a ghost. I mean it is, but it doesn't really do anything. It just sits there all symbolic-like.)<br/><br/>I really enjoyed reading this. It was well written, suspenseful and it had some great characters. What I didn't like were most of the interaction scenes between Fiona, the protagonist, and her boyfriend. There was something sloppy about the way their relationship was presented, as if the author wasn't quite sure if she wanted a love interest for Fiona but decided to give her one at the last minute.<br/><br/>",,,1,0

I have absolutely no memory of them, but I remember the title and the fact that I enjoyed them. I had completely forgotten about the existence of Anthony Horowitz until quite recently, when I read <i>The House of Silk</i>, a book I really liked. After that I read <i>Moriarty</i>, which was fine. Next in line was <i>Magpie Murders</i>, a whodunnit that I enjoyed immensely. <br/>So it's fair to say that I was really excited about reading <i>The Word is Murder</i>. I mean, come on, the guy knows how to write good murder-mystery stories.<br/><br/>Imagine my disappointment when I actually picked up the damn book and realised that it's basically a pseudo-memoir of Horowitz which mainly served as an advertisement for his work.<br/><br/>I have so many issues that I don't even know where to begin. So I think I'll just write my scattered thoughts here without any effort to appear coherent.<br/><br/>Horowitz's self-insertion is as infuriating as it is ridiculous. There is no point whatsoever in his decision to include himself in the story. This is not a memoir, it is a detective tale. Had it been a memoir, I would not have read it, because my interest in Horowitz's life is absolute zero. <br/>You get pages upon pages of Horowitz babbling on about Alex Rider and Midsomer Murders and Foyle's War and TinTin and I just found myself wanting to scream ""LITERALLY NO ONE CARES! JUST GET ON WITH THE STORY"".<br/><br/>So I guess this is my first issue. Horowitz's promotion of his work in the book is not only self-indulgent but also shameless in its transparency. I felt like he was constantly insulting the intelligence of the reader. Who, in this case, was me. <br/><br/>What's more, Horowitz doesn't restrict his utterly unnecessary gabble to the books and screenplays he's written. No, you also get a great amount of references about other books and series and movies that serve absolutely no purpose. It almost felt like reading <i>Ready</i> fucking <i>Player One</i> all over again. Additionally, you get to read Horowitz's critique about said books and series and movies:<br/><br/><i>Only a week ago, a middle-aged woman would have undressed here, standing in front of the full-length mirror, sliding into the queen-sized bed with the copy of Stieg Larsson’s The Girl Who Played with Fire that was lying on the bedside table. Well, at least Mrs Cowper had been spared the slightly disappointing ending.</i><br/><br/>Oh piss off, Tony, I wish I had been spared your disappointing book.<br/><br/><br/>As if Horowitz's decision to include himself in the narrative was not bad enough, we get a second main character, Hawthorne, who is an awful human being. Just... <i>terrible</i>. Horowitz says so himself multiple times in the book. So why did he create such an unbearable protagonist? Why did he decide to create a homophobic scum who may or may not have tried to kill someone on purpose while working as a cop, and make him the hero of the story? And why on earth does it feel like he's trying to make us like him by the end? I'll tell you why:<br/><br/><i>I remember once that I was asked about gay marriage on a radio programme. This was at a time when a Christian husband and wife with a hotel in Cornwall had refused to give a room to a gay couple. I was careful. To begin with, I made it clear that I was one hundred per cent in favour of gay marriage and that I didn’t agree with the hotel owners at all. However, having established that, I went on to say that we should try to understand their point of view, which was at least based on some sort of religious conviction (even if I didn’t share it), and that perhaps they didn’t deserve the hate mail and the death threats they had received. We need to tolerate intolerance. I thought that was a neat encapsulation of what I believed.</i><br/><br/>One more time, in case you missed it:<br/><br/><i>We need to tolerate intolerance.</i><br/><br/>Now, at this point, which occurs fairly early, I'm already debating whether I should put the book down and go read some Mira Grant.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I decided that I should keep reading because I wanted to find out who the murderer was. Which brings me to my next issue.<br/>The story is predictable for the most part, and the bits of it that aren't predictable make little to no sense. I can't really discuss this at length without getting into spoilers, so suffice it to say that it was utterly unconvincing.<br/>So I went through the trouble of reading this insufferable book and didn't even get the satisfaction of a decent ending.<br/><br/>I have quite a few more issues like the, at times, unbearable dialogue and the really slow pacing, but it's 2.30 in the morning here and if I succumb to my need to nitpick every single detail of the book I won't get any sleep at all.",,,1,0

They are not allowed to read or write and they can only speak one hundred words per day. If they exceed this limit they get an electric shock through a bracelet they are forced to wear, which functions as a word counter. They can't vote, they can't get abortions, they can't even buy condoms. They are not allowed to have a passport or a bank account, they are not allowed to work and, if they don't get married at a young age, they get sent to a farm that is, for all intents and purposes, a prison. <br/><br/>Of course, none of this happens overnight. The world begins to change little by little, and this terrifying dystopia comes to be because people are apathetic.<br/><br/>The message <i>Vox</i> wants to convey is very clear. As Edmund Burke said: ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."" And this is a good an important message. The failure of the book, for me, is its execution.<br/><br/><i>Vox</i> has many good qualities. It makes you feel things, mostly fury. Not that this is hard, given the premise. I don't particularly like its lack of subtlety and it didn't really give me anything new to think about, but it definitely tries, and that is always a good thing. It points out that 'good' people constantly let bad things happen. <br/><br/><i>I keep reminding myself it isn’t my fault. I didn’t vote for Myers.<br/>I didn’t vote at all, actually.<br/>And here’s Jackie’s voice again, telling me what an acquiescent shit I am.<br/>“You have to vote, Jean,” she said, throwing down the stack of campaign leaflets she’d been running around campus with while I was prepping for what I knew would be a monster of an oral exam. “You have to.”<br/>“The only things I have to do are pay taxes and die,” I said, not holding back the sneer in my voice. That semester was the beginning of the end for Jackie and me. I’d started dating Patrick and preferred our nightly discussions about cognitive processes to Jackie’s rants about whatever new thing she had found to protest. Patrick was safe and quiet, and he let me bury myself in my work while he crammed for one medical school exam after another.</i><br/><br/>It acknowledges white feminism.<br/><br/><i>“So how long do you think it’s gonna be before Reverend Carl and his holy Pure Blue sheep get it in their heads that it ain’t just women and men who were made differently under God’s eyes, but blacks and whites? You think mixed marriages like mine are part of the plan? If you do, you’re not as smart as I thought.”<br/>I feel myself going red. “I never thought about it.”<br/>“Course you never. Look, I don’t mean to be unkind, but you white gals, all you’re worried about is, well, all you’re worried about is you white gals. Me, I got more to fret over than whether I have a hundred words a day. I got my girls, too. We still send ’em to that school and do what we can on the weekends, until we can figure out a way to get out of here and over the border, but Del and I know a tide’s comin’ in. I guess before the year’s out, we’ll start seein’ more than just separate schools for boys and girls. And just like now, they ain’t gonna be equal.”</i><br/><br/>The book suddenly changes its tone in the second half. It becomes a bit cartoon-y. Whereas in the first half the villains are terrifying, in the second one they become a bit ridiculous, the 'twirling of moustache' kind. The pacing accelerates. Everything feels a bit forced. People change too fast. The suspension of disbelief is shattered.<br/><br/>My problem is that I wanted bloodshed. With a premise like this, anything short of a complete fucking revolution with thousands of complacent people dying is a failure in my eyes. But that's just me. <br/>What bothered me most was actually this: in the end, it's men who save the day. <br/>And, you know, fuck that.",,,1,0

He was convicted of second-degree murder in November 1975.<br/>In December 1975, George and Kathy Lutz and their three children moved into the house. After 28 days, the Lutzes left the house, claiming to have been terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there.<br/><br/>Jay Anson heard about this story and thought ""Hey, you know what? I bet I can take advantage of these people who genuinely believe in ghosts and make a lot of money out of it"". What a noble man.<br/>But let us, for the moment, leave Ansen’s moral issues aside, and instead focus on the book as a piece of fiction.<br/><br/>A family moves into a house that's clearly haunted. With this premise, as an author, you only have one job: make the damn book scary. If you can't do scary, at least try for creepy. How can you do that? By being a good writer. Is Jay Anson a good writer? I'm afraid not. <br/><br/>The whole book was written in a very distant way, reminiscent of a police report. Anson probably did that on purpose, trying to reinforce the idea that this story is real, but realized halfway through that this doesn’t really work. So, after a certain point, he tries to evoke emotions like surprise or terror with the excessive use of exclamation marks. And I truly mean excessive.<br/>I admit to having an aversion to exclamation marks. I think that they should be used frugally, otherwise, your sentences end up looking like they were written by a child. <br/>So, in the end, The Amityville Horror feels like a police report where the cop let his 5-year-old kid chip in.<br/><br/>I'm assuming that, by now, you know the drill, so let us take a look at a few (out of about a million) examples of what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>-<i>But when she entered the bathroom, she was struck by a completely different odour, an overpowering stench. Kathy gagged and started to cough, but before she ran, caught a glimpse of her toilet bowl. It was totally black inside!</i><br/>(I mean, come on, that's exactly how a kid talks. ""It was totally black inside! And it was, like, gross and stuff!"")<br/><br/>-<i>On the window, clinging to the inside of the panes, were literally hundreds of buzzing flies!</i><br/>(And they were, like, buzzing and being gross and stuff!)<br/><br/>-<i>As Kathy looked at it now, her eyes widened in horror. She began to gag at the sour smell, but couldn't retreat from the sight of the crucifix -now hanging upside down!</i><br/><br/>-<i>Directly behind his daughter, frighteningly visible to George, was the face of a pig! He was sure he could see the little red eyes glaring at him!</i><br/><br/>-<i>There was a creak behind him. He turned. Beside the window that looked out at the boathouse, Missy's little chair was slowly rocking back and forth!</i><br/><br/>-<i>Slowly, Kathy looked over her shoulder. She could see the kitchen was empty -but at the same time, she sensed that the presence was closer, almost directly behind her chair!</i><br/><br/>-<i>Hurriedly, he slipped the thermometer back under his tongue: 98.6 degrees. His fever was gone!</i><br/><br/>-<i>His expression froze. He shoves his hand into the pocket, it came out empty! Jimmy searched the other pocket. Again, nothing. He tore off the raincoat, shaking it, then turned out every pocket in his uniform. The money was gone! It was impossible, but Jimmy's fifteen hundred had completely disappeared!</i><br/><br/>I rest my case. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if your book contains pieces of dialogue like this:<br/><i>""No honey,” George said. “There’s no way you can convince me a lot of this isn’t just our imagination. I just don’t believe in spooks! No way, no how, no time!""</i><br/>and you rely solely on punctuation for making me feel anything, the only emotion you’ll succeed in evoking in me is anger. And you'll get a 1-star rating.<br/><br/><br/>Returning to Anson’s morality, in the afterword of the book we get a Note From The Author:<br/><i>""To the extent that I can verify them, all the events in this book are true.""</i><br/>No, they’re fucking not, piss off.<br/><br/>The phrase ""to the extend that I can verify them"" means absolutely fuck all when you haven’t gone into the trouble of doing any kind of research. Which is understandable because, had you done that, you would end up with evidence that none of this happened. What you’re saying is basically ""Hey, who am I to question what these people are telling me? I don’t need to do research, what am I, a fucking journalist? All I want is to make money by writing a ghost story. It doesn’t matter that I don’t have the imagination needed in order to do that, there are two wonderfully delusional people whom I can take advantage of. I won’t even bother getting an editor for this piece of trash. I’m going to be rich!""<br/><br/>Fuck you, Anson.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You can also find this review here: https://tokillamockingjay.home.blog/2019/04/07/the-amityville-horror-by-jay-anson/",,,1,0

Εδώ μιλάμε για μηδέν ορίτζιναλ ιδέες. <br/><br/>Η γραφή ήταν εξαιρετική, του το δίνω αυτό. Και ήταν λετζίτ τρομακτικό σε πολλά σημεία, παρ' ολο που πολλά τα έβλεπες να έρχονται.

I felt like I was reading a combination of <i>The Shining</i> and <i>The Woman In Black</i>, sprinkled with details from every other haunted-house story in existence. Not that I'm expecting 100% originality from a Horror book that deals with a haunted house, but I'd love at least a <i>bit</i> or originality. Just a tiny bit. A smidgen. We're talking about zero original ideas here.<br/><br/>The writing was indeed excellent, I'll give it that. And I got genuinely scared in a lot of parts, even though you could see them coming from a mile away. But it was a bit problematic in so many ways and there were so many small plot holes and it was so much longer than it felt necessary and considering all of these things I just couldn't find it in me to give this more than 3 stars, although I'm still interested in reading more by this author.",,,1,0

I finished the damn book! <br/>And my problem with it, as opposed to the previous two Stephen King's books I read, wasn't so much the creepy description of teenage breasts and nipples or the horribly hateful way in which he portrays fat people (although there was obviously a lot of that. Don't forget, this <i> is </i> a Stephen King book.) <br/>No, my main issue here was the fact that this book is <i> unbearably </i> boring. Probably the most boring book I have ever read. Ever.<br/><br/>I won't talk about all the things that bothered me. If I did this wouldn't be a review, it would be a whole essay, and I definitely have better things to do with my time. So I'll be brief and only mention a few things that drove me insane.<br/><br/>I've said it before and I'll say it again and I'll keep saying it until my dying day:<br/><b> STEPHEN KING IS A BAD WRITER. </b><br/><br/>Remember my review of <i> Carrie, </i> where I mentioned a few of King's tips on how to be a good writer? One of them was ""Don't get overly caught up on grammar"". Well, Stephen, when you don't care much about the rules of language, you end up with things like this (which is, by far, my absolutely favourite line in <i> Christine</i>):<br/><br/><b>  ""Hey, no! Put that away, man!"" That sounded very much ungood. </b><br/><br/><img src=""http://cdn1.clevver.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ridiculous-college-classes-scrabble.gif"" width=""450"" height=""250"" /><br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, on to my second favourite excerpt. At some point, Dennis, the protagonist and narrator of half of the story, encounters two kids that keep using the word ""poopy-kaka"" (whatever, they're kids). Their father enters the scene and we get the following gem:<br/><br/><b> ""What you doing out here? You want me to put a bang-shang-a-lang on you?"" <br/>Oh God, what an onomatopoeic family, I thought. For Christ's sake don't put a bang-shang-a-lang on them, Pops -they might make poopy-kaka in their pants. </b><br/><br/>I can't find the words to describe how much I hated this particular excerpt. So I won't. But I will say this:<br/><b> POOPY-KAKA IS NOT ONOMATOPOEIA, YOU FUCKING MORON. </b><br/><br/>I can't believe this is a phrase that I have now said. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Moving on. <br/>There were particular bits that made me want to throw this book at the wall. I will list them in detail because I suffered and so you must too.<br/><br/>Let's count, for example, the instances where someone laughs, but not really:<br/><br/><i>• He laughed anyway -a little defensive laugh.<br/>• I was still laughing, but it wasn't a good laughter anymore.<br/>• ...and then uttered a shakey little laugh.<br/>• LeBay laughed... a little reluctantly, I thought.<br/>• I laughed a little. It was a shakey sound.<br/>• I laughed again, but this time it sounded even more shakey.<br/>• ...and make myself utter a defensive little laugh.<br/>• Arnie uttered a harsh laugh.<br/>• He uttered a crazy laugh.<br/>• They laughed. But it was a brief laughter, and not really that good.<br/>• Arnie agreed and they both laughed a little -although it was a sad sort of laughter.<br/>• ...Arnie said, and laughed his almost-genuine laugh.<br/>• Arnie laughed. It was a hard, contemptuous sound.<br/>• He laughed a short, embarrassed laugh.<br/>• ...Pomberton said, and then uttered a laugh without much humour.<br/>• Junkins uttered a laugh without much humour.<br/>• Junkins uttered a bewildered little laugh.<br/>• She laughed nervously at this last, as if trying to tale the curse off an obvious absurdity.<br/>• He laughed, an ugly, contemptuous sound. </i><br/><br/><br/>Have you had enough? OK, let's move on to Leigh, the love interest. I'll spare you the instances where her breasts are mentioned without any obvious reason (other than the fact that this book is written by King). Instead, let's focus on her arrogant cheekbones:<br/><br/><i>• A cornfed American beauty, you would have said, except for the high cheekbones, which seemed a little arrogant.<br/>• I was struck by her beauty again, calm and undemanding except for those high, arrogant cheekbones -the sort of cheekbones you expect to see on a lady probably carrying a knife in her belt. </i> (?????)<br/><i>• Leigh, with her lovely face (enhanced by those slanting, almost cruel cheekbones)...<br/>• I could feel the passion those high cheekbones hinted at.<br/>• ...she of the pink nylon scarf and the arrogant Nordic cheekbones. </i><br/><br/><br/>I'm tired. I'm done.<br/><br/>I do have one last thing to say, however. I get that there are people who like King's books, I really do. Some of his ideas are really interesting and he can write creepy scenes that get under your skin and make you feel very uneasy (I'm not talking teenage-pornography-creepy, but ghost-demon-clowns-creepy. Although he can definitely do both.)<br/>BUT. To anyone claiming that he is a good writer on a technical level, to anyone that enjoys his prose: Would you honestly, HONESTLY, still claim you like his prose if he were a woman writing YA or romance novels? Would you?? Would you admire his masterful grip on the English language??<br/><br/>NO! YOU WOULDN'T! FIGHT ME!",,,1,0

It is not very well written and it is certainly very badly edited. <br/><br/>I have two problems concerning the writing.<br/><br/>Firstly, Matson describes every single thing with excruciating detail.<br/><br/><i> We tucked in the sheet, then the top sheet, and pulled the comforter over them, then tossed the pillows onto the bed. I straightened them out and gave them a quick fluff and decided that was probably as good as it was going to get. </i><br/><br/>We all more or less know how a bed is made, thank you. A simple ""we made the bed as best we could"" would suffice.<br/><br/>Secondly, Matson repeats herself. A LOT. <br/><br/>Along with the endless times someone ""<i>winces</i>"" and there is a silence ""<i>so thick that it feels like a physical presence</i>"", there are repetitions of whole scenes.<br/>For example, something is happening in the kitchen. <br/>Person A enters the kitchen and says ""oh, so this is happening"" and the people around them confirm that, indeed, this is happening. <br/>Person B enters the kitchen and says ""oh, this is happening"" and the people there, along with person A, say ""yep, this is happening"".<br/>Person C enters the kitchen and says ""oh wow, this is happening"" and the people there, along with persons A and B, confirm.<br/>Person D enters the kitchen...<br/><br/>Well, you get the idea. <br/>I think this was meant to be funny and, had this been a movie, it probably would be. But in a book format it is almost painful.<br/><br/><br/>There are definitely some very charming and funny moments and, even though most of the characters are not likeable to begin with, they sort of redeem themselves by the end.<br/><br/>I think my main problem, though, is best illustrated by the following excerpt <spoiler> in which Charlie has just found out that her parents are getting a divorce</spoiler>.<br/><br/><i> We just sat there for a moment, and I couldn't help but wonder if it was what people who've just been in an earthquake or a tornado felt. When you're standing among the rubble and wreckage of what just moments earlier had been your life, wondering how you got there and what happened now that everything was destroyed. </i><br/><br/>This bugs me beyond words, but what I basically mean is that this book had might as well been called ""Rich white people problems"".",,,1,0

I think I've mentioned this in another review as well but, in cases like this, I am reminded of M. Night Shyamalan's <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368447/"">The Village</a> which people seemed to hate when it first came out because they expected a monster movie. Well, it isn't a monster movie, it's a romance and a rather good one at that. But because it was marketed as Horror, people (myself included) were annoyed.<br/><br/>Similarly, <i>A House at the Bottom of a Lake</i> is not a Horror novella (even though it was published by This Is Horror), but a Young Adult romance story at its core with a couple of Horror elements. Unlike <i>The Village</i>, though, I don't think it's a very <i>good</i> romance story. It had great moments; almost every scene where the titular house is described was suspenseful and I quite liked the ending. But Malerman fails miserably to capture the teenage protagonists' voices and don't even get me started on the sexual scenes between them -those were truly cringeworthy.<br/><br/>I'm leaving it at 3 stars for now but it's entirely possible that I'll think about it some more and find more things that bugged me about it.",,,1,0

Or short story. I never learned how to distinguish the two. It's classified under Best Horror on the Goodreads Choice Awards of 2018. Which makes me think that the people that voted for it didn’t actually read it; otherwise why on earth would they classify it as horror? I’m not being a prick here, I don’t mean that King meant it to be a horror novel and failed, I mean that it genuinely isn’t meant to be a horror novel.<br/>What it’s meant to be, I’m not sure. A statement, perhaps. A reminder that, even though Stephen King has said and written some controversial stuff in the past, he is, at heart, a Good Guy; one that cares about his fellow humans and firmly believes that love can conquer all.<br/><br/>Yeah, it doesn’t sound much like him, does it? Wait until you find out that this book doesn’t even contain some kind of description of a woman’s tits. I would be tempted to doubt that it was really written by King, had it not been for his fucking obsession with weight.<br/><br/>Let's read the blurb:<br/><blockquote><i><b>The latest from legendary master storyteller Stephen King, a riveting, extraordinarily eerie, and moving story about a man whose mysterious affliction brings a small town together—a timely, upbeat tale about finding common ground despite deep-rooted differences.</b></i></blockquote><br/>OK. First of all, this story is neither extraordinarily eerie nor moving. Second of all, the man’s mysterious affliction, which I will get into in a minute, does nothing to bring the small town together. What happens is that our protagonist decides that he wants to end the prejudice in the town he lives in, and does so in a way that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever because the real world doesn’t work like that.<br/><br/>Let us now dive into the plot. And be warned that there will be spoilers, because I really don’t care.<br/><br/>Scott Carey weighs less and less every day, but, for some mysterious and magical reason, continues to retain mass. He weighs the same whether he wears clothes or not, no matter how heavy they might be. But Scott doesn’t want to go to the hospital so the doctors can study him like a lab rat. So he does the next best thing, which is basically nothing. I mean, he does go visit a friend of his who is a retired doctor and asks for advice, but, as the retired doctor has absolutely no idea what the fuck is going on, they both decide to do nothing and just wait and see what happens.<br/><br/>This is almost as far as this part of the plot goes. Scott keeps losing weight day after day, but we’re not really bothered with that. What we are bothered with is his relationship with his new neighbours: Deirdre and Missy, a married lesbian couple. Now, Scott lives in a small town full of homophobic people (one of which is the retired doctor’s wife) who claim that they don’t really have an issue with Deirdre and Missy being gay, but they do have a problem with the fact that they are married; therefore, they refuse to go and eat at the couple’s newly opened restaurant. Naturally, the restaurant isn’t going well at all, and Deirdre and Missy don’t have any friends. Enter Scott.<br/><br/>Scott decides that he wants to be Deirdre and Missy’s friend. Deirdre, however, doesn’t really like Scott, so she politely tells him to piss off and go join his stupid homophobic friends. But Scott is having none of that. He needs to convince Deirdre that he is not, in fact, a homophobe, like his fellow citizens. He is determined to prove to her that he is a Good Guy. So, after overhearing some assholes going on about how much they hate gay marriage, he almost gets into a fight with them, trying to defend the couple’s honour. Deirdre, then, gets pissed off. “We don’t need your help, Good Guy,” she says to Scott, “go bother someone else.” But Scott is persistent. “Why don’t you like me, Lesbian Couple? I need to be your friend and prove to you that not all men!”<br/><br/>Then the marathon happens. Deirdre is a runner -has been for years- and joins the marathon because that’s what she likes to do. She also wants to prove to the stupid town folks that she not only is better but can run faster than them as well. Scott joins the marathon because he wants to bother Deirdre some more. He makes a bet with her: if she wins the marathon, he’ll leave her alone for good; if he wins, she has to give him a chance and she and Missy have to have dinner with him or something along these lines. She laughs in his face and agrees. Don’t forget that she’s a professional runner. There’s no way Scott can beat her.<br/><br/>At this point, a few people approach Scott with concern, telling him that maybe him joining the marathon isn’t such a good idea. After all, he’s kind of fat. Fat people can’t possibly run, can they? But this weird condition makes it extremely easy for him to do any sort of physical exercise, and so, naturally, he ends up right before Deirdre, who is in the lead. That is, up until the last few meters, where she somehow stumbles and falls.<br/><br/>Long story short, Scott helps her get up and lets her win. Because that’s not condescending at all. Deirdre crosses the finishing line first and meets her wife Missy there. They hug. Scott finishes second and somehow also gets involved in the couple’s hug. I don’t know why, but all three of them are hugging now. There’s a reporter there. He takes a picture of the group hugging. The next morning the picture is on the internet.<br/><br/>And suddenly… Everyone just stops being homophobic. That’s it. They just stop. With the power of the internet. And the magic of hugs. Deirdre and Missy’s restaurant is going really well now. They have friends. One of them is Scott. Another one is the retired doctor. The retired doctor’s wife stops being homophobic because she discovers that she and Deirdre have a common interest: mushrooms. They have dinner. They laugh. They bond. They have a lovely time. They live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Except for Scott, because he dies.<br/><br/>Yeah, at some point he inevitably loses all of his weight and ends up floating in the sky and dying. If I remember correctly, Deirdre helps him do it. Like letting go of a balloon or something like that.<br/><br/>The End.<br/><br/>And that’s it, folks. This is the whole plot of Elevation.<br/><br/>After reading this story, I tried to pinpoint the exact reason why it bothered me. At first I thought it was because it’s willfully naive. It almost reads like a fairy tale. The hateful town folks magically change, love prevails, everyone is happy. But this is not exactly a bad thing. In fact, I wish things worked like that in real life. So maybe it’s not the naivety of it that bugged me.<br/><br/>Then it hit me. What bothers me is the fact that Scott is presented as the hero for doing absolutely fuck all. He is the hero because he is the only one in the town that treats Deirdre and Missy with common decency. He is the hero for doing the bare minimum. Is this what we’ve reduced our heroes to? Some dude that constantly bothers a woman, insisting that she has to let him prove something to her? Never mind that Deirdre tells him, repeatedly, to fuck off.<br/><br/>And the infuriating thing is that, in the end, he succeeds. Because this book is a Good Guy’s fantasy. He doesn’t really care about helping anyone. He only wants people to know that he is a Good Guy. That he has Good Opinions. That he is not All Men. Who cares if he’s done nothing to deserve such a title? The fact that he has certain opinions ought to be enough, right? This is what the Good Guy thinks.<br/><br/>And in the end, after the weight of all of society’s beliefs and stereotypes is lifted off his chest, he can finally fly into the night and be free. And who the fuck cares about the heavy people he’s leaving behind, the ones he has done absolutely nothing to help? Oh, but he has helped them. He has helped them by letting them know what Good Opinions he has. He is a Good Guy. He is free. He is elevated.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You can also find my review here:<br/>https://tokillamockingjay.home.blog/2019/03/07/elevation/",,,1,0

It might actually be my favourite retelling of all time, period. I used to be obsessed with Disney's version of the story as a kid and I loved Belle more than any other character in a movie. Maybe because she constantly had her nose stuck in a book.<br/><br/>The problem with this fairytale is the fact that romance is born out of kidnapping. And sure, in the Disney version, the Beast didn't <i>technically</i> kidnap Belle but I will argue that kidnapping her father and emotionally manipulating her to stay in the castle isn’t exactly better. You can hardly call that gentleman-y behaviour.<br/><br/>Anyway, the kidnapping aspect will always be a problem, so we might as well set it aside for now and accept that this is what we have to work with. After all, in Disney’s version, as well as in <i>Bryony and Roses</i>, Beauty (respectively, Bryony) doesn’t actually admit that she loves the Beast until he lets her go and then come back on her own free will. That’s something, I guess.<br/><br/>The thing is, in most versions of this story the Beast is a terrible person, to begin with. This is especially true in Disney’s movie. The Beast is manipulative, entitled, obnoxious and abusive. He kidnaps Belle’s father, then forces Belle to stay in the castle as a prisoner, then denies her food because she refuses to have dinner with him. What a bucket of dicks. Had there not been Lumiere and Cogsworth to try and reason with him, Belle would almost certainly end up dead.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Lumiere and Cogsworth do succeed reasoning with the Beast and, as the story progresses, he and Belle get to know, like and understand each other. They eventually fall in love. Gaston dies, something that will surely result in an excess of eggs in the village. The Beast turns into a prince. One must assume that he and Belle will also die, eventually, because -let’s not forget- the story takes place in a revolution-era France and they’re royalty.<br/><blockquote>""<i>Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight, and now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents... a guillotine!</i>""</blockquote><br/>Yes, I <i>am</i> fun at parties. But I digress.<br/><br/>The main reason why I loved <i>Bryony and Roses</i> so much is the fact that the Beast is <i>never</i> a dick. I mean, yes, he kidnaps Bryony, but we have established that we can't help it at this point, this is how the story will always go. But he's never a dick about it. In fact, he is intelligent, extremely charming and very funny in a sarcastic kind of way. It's really hard <i>not</i> to fall in love with him when you first meet him. This makes the whole falling-in-love business much easier to understand. I'm not necessarily saying that it's <i>right</i>. Just... easier. Seriously, though, don't fall in love with people who kidnap you, kids.<br/><blockquote><i>Bryony snorted and let her arms fall to her sides. “I suppose we will have plenty of time, unless you plan to sacrifice me to the moon gods on the next equinox, or something equally nefarious.”<br/>“Don’t be ridiculous,” said the Beast. “The moon gods require virgin sacrifices on the solstice, not the equinox.”<br/>“They’re twice out of luck there, then,” said Bryony. <br/>The Beast’s face writhed into a mass of teeth and tusks, and Bryony had a bad moment when she thought that her virginity might actually be what he was after, for some unknown magical reason—But damnit, he should have asked, not just assumed, and I’m not ashamed, it’s not like I ever planned to get married anyway, and even if by some chance I did it wouldn’t be to someone who cared about a thing like that—and then she realized that he wasn’t angry.<br/>The Beast was smiling.<br/>“I think we shall get along very well, Miss…what shall I call you?”<br/>“Bryony,” said Bryony. “And what shall I call you?”<br/>“Beast,” said the Beast. He stretched out a hand, not to touch her, but holding it palm up in a way that was oddly reassuring, despite the claws. “And have I not already said that no harm will come to you? There will be no sacrifices, virgin or otherwise. On this you have my word.”</i></blockquote><br/>Come on, you have to admit that this is a <i>suave</i> Beast.<br/><br/><spoiler>Another reason why I love it so much is the fact that, in the end, the Beast doesn't turn into a prince. He doesn't even turn into a man, he just stays Beast and moves in with Bryony and her sisters in their lovely cottage with its beautiful garden and they truly live happily ever after. That's it. No prince. No palace. No guillotine.</spoiler><br/><br/>Extra reasons why I loved this book:<br/>- Bryony's badass sister Holly beating up horrible people<br/>- Stupid adorable pony<br/>- Rutabagas beat roses<br/>- Fuck the rich<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You can also find my review here: https://tokillamockingjay.home.blog/2019/06/14/bryony-and-roses-by-t-kingfisher/",,,1,0

This didn't have any bearing in the story, though, so it's neither here nor there.<br/><br/>Dunk and Egg are great characters; I particularly like Egg's endearing sassiness (which reminds me of Arya).<br/><br/><i>The Hedge Knight</i> was a good introduction to the main characters but I found it rather forgettable.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the <i>The Sworn Sword</i> much more. It had the complexity that I loved about ASOIAF (on a much smaller scale, of course) and the characters introduced were neither good nor bad, but morally grey (as are most characters that are actually interesting).<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>""Treason... is only a word. When two princes fight for a chair where only one may sit, great lords and common men alike must choose. And when the battle's done, the victors will be hailed as loyal men and true, whilst those who were defeated will be known forevermore as rebels and traitors.""</b></i></blockquote><br/><br/><i>The Mystery Knight</i> was also more complex than the first story and there was a <i>lot</i> more intrigue. A satisfying end to the book.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed <i>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</i>. It had a kind of fairy-tale vibe to it, which might sound weird because there were quite a few violent scenes in it, but it's actually not; just think of the Grimm brothers.<br/><br/><br/>PS. Word count.<br/>The phrase ""clout in the ear"" is written 24 times. The word ""clout"", on its own, 32 times. It nearly drove me insane.",,,1,0

When I was a kid, my dream was to become a detective and solve mysteries every day. That didn’t turn out as I planned. I actually became a mathematician, which, come to think of it, is kind of like being a detective in some ways; you need to study the facts you have and come up with a solution for the mystery at hand. “Solve the mystery of who is x in this equation”. I’d rather solve the mystery of who murdered my neighbour, but what can you do.<br/><br/>Real life is kind of boring, isn’t it? There aren’t many mysteries to solve. That’s why we have to rely on books. And there is nobody on the world that writes better mystery books than Agatha Christie. I’m serious. <i>Nobody.</i><br/><br/>And, in my book, there isn’t a better detective than Miss Marple. And what makes her the best is that she’s not even a real detective. She’s just an old lady who is extremely good at observing things, especially human behaviour.<br/><br/><br/><i>“Well, my dear,” said Miss Marple, “human nature is much the same everywhere, and, of course, one has opportunities of observing it at close quarters in a village.”</i><br/><br/><br/><i>The Thirteen Problems</i> is a story about a group of friends who get together every week or so and share unsolved mysteries they have encountered in their lives, challenging each other to find the solution to each one. Of course, in the beginning, no one bothers with Miss Marple, they only include her in the game because they want to be polite.<br/><br/><br/><i>“You have forgotten me, dear,” said Miss Marple, smiling brightly.<br/>Joyce was slightly taken aback, but she concealed the fact quickly.<br/>“That would be lovely, Miss Marple,” she said. “I didn’t think you would care to play.”<br/>“I think it would be very interesting,” said Miss Marple, “especially with so many clever gentlemen present. I am afraid I am not clever myself, but living all these years in St Mary Mead does give one an insight into human nature.”</i><br/><br/><br/>Now, I might be wrong here, but I don’t believe for a moment that Miss Marple thinks she isn’t smart. And my absolute favourite thing about her is how low-key smug she is. She says things like “oh I’m not smart, I just happened to remember a similar thing that happened in the village a long time ago, see, it was just luck” but I think that what she really means is “you’re all a bunch of morons and I’m smarter than all of you combined”.<br/><br/><br/><i>“I mean,” said Miss Marple, puckering her brow a little as she counted the stitches in her knitting, “that so many people seem to me not to be either good or bad, but simply, you know, very silly.”</i><br/><br/><br/>Everyone expects Hercule Poirot to be smart and solve mysteries. That’s his job. But they constantly underestimate and dismiss Miss Marple, because she is an old lady. And what do old ladies know?<br/><br/>Listen to me. Old ladies know <i>everything</i>. They are the most interesting people in the whole world. And yet they are also the most easily dismissed people in our society. “She’s just an old lady, what does she know?” Dude. Have you ever talked to an old lady? I mean <i>really</i> talked to her? Has any old lady ever talked to you about her life? If she has, then you know what I’m talking about. If not, well, go find an old lady and talk to her. You’ll be lucky if she agrees to tell you her stories. <br/><br/>In <i>The Thirteen Problems</i>, the person who underestimates Miss Marple the most, as it often happens, is the person who ought to know by now that he should never ever do that: Raymond, her own nephew. Thankfully, Miss Marple always finds a way to (politely) tell him off.<br/><br/><br/><i>“Well, go on, Aunt Jane; haven’t you got anything to say?”<br/>“In a minute, dear,” said Miss Marple. “I am afraid I have counted wrong. Two purls, three plain, slip one, two purl – yes, that’s right. What did you say, dear?”<br/>“What is your opinion?”<br/>“You wouldn’t like my opinion, dear. Young people never do, I notice. It is better to say nothing.”<br/>“Nonsense, Aunt Jane; out with it.”<br/>“Well, dear Raymond,” said Miss Marple, laying down her knitting and looking across at her nephew. “I do think you should be more careful how you choose your friends. You are so credulous, dear, so easily gulled. I suppose it is being a writer and having so much imagination. All that story about a Spanish galleon! If you were older and had more experience in life you would have been on your guard at once. A man you had known only a few weeks, too!”</i><br/><br/><br/>Translation: “Raymond, dear, you’re an absolute twat. “<br/><br/>These are my favourite moments in the book. The friends start sharing their unsolved mysteries and Miss Marple just sits there, listening intently, never interrupting. After everyone has shared their (often ridiculous) theories, she laughs a little bit and reveals the solution. And everybody is shocked by how easily she came to it. Meanwhile, she keeps on knitting, smiling to herself, thinking (I like to believe) “How do you like that, you sexist, ageist cretins?”.<br/><br/>My second favourite thing about Miss Marple is her ramblings. That’s probably because I can relate. (Hello, people in my life who more than once have told me “You’ve been talking for hours, get to the fucking point!”)<br/><br/><br/><i>“No, dear, not quite,” said Miss Marple. “You see, if I were going to kill anyone – which, of course, I wouldn’t dream of doing, because it would be very wicked, and besides I don’t like killing – not even wasps, though I know it has to be, and I’m sure the gardener does it as humanely as possible. Let me see, what was I saying?”</i><br/><br/><br/>Come on, people, how can you not absolutely adore her?<br/><br/>Lastly, while I really do believe that she’s smug, that doesn’t stop her from also being very wise, as old ladies so often are.<br/><br/><br/><i>“You see, perhaps, what I am coming to? It is, so often, the unexpected that happens in this world. I was so sure, and that, I think, was what blinded me. But facts are facts, and if one is proved wrong, one must just be humble about it and start again.”</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>PS. By the way, my neighbour wasn’t actually murdered, so don’t worry about that.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You can also find my review here: https://tokillamockingjay.home.blog/2019/03/28/the-thirteen-problems-by-agatha-christie/",,,1,0

Why did I think so? Because it's on the Mystery/Thriller shelf on Goodreads. So my main issue here is not the book per se, but the way it was marketed to me. I should have paid closer attention to the fact that Netgalley had it under General Fiction (Adult) and Women's Fiction, but even if I did I honestly have no idea what General Fiction or Women's Fiction actually is. Is it Women's Fiction because one of the two main characters is a woman? Or is it because it mostly deals with feelings and, as we know, men don't have any of those? This bugs me, but it's besides the point.<br/><br/><i>Tell No One</i> is neither a thriller nor a mystery. It's a clear-cut drama, and a good one at that. The problem is that I don't really like dramas. Never did. They bore me to death. And since my rating of (fiction) books is almost solely based on my enjoyment of them, this one gets 3 stars, and I'm being generous here.<br/><br/>Let me say this again and make it clear: I think this is a <i>good</i> book. I like Sissel's prose a lot. I like the relationship between Caro and her daughter (we really need more honest and healthy relationships like this one, in books as well as in real life). I like that the characters of the book felt like real people. But it's not a book for me. This is purely a matter of taste. You can still appreciate how well-written a book is or how well-directed a movie is without having to enjoy it.<br/><br/>So, I think that if you like dramas, you should definitely give <i>Tell No One</i> a go. But if, like me, you don't pay much attention and just judge a book by its cover and/or title and expect a page-turning thriller, maybe you should stay clear of this one.<br/><br/><br/>Thank you, Netgalley.",,,1,0

Well, I was expecting Little Tales of Misogyny, you know, short stories that point to the misogyny around us, that address the issues that women have to face in our everyday lives. I guess I was mistaken. After a little bit of research, I found out that the original title of the book was <i> Kleine Geschichte für Weiberfeinde </i>, which literally translates to <i> Little Tales for Misogynists </i>. And, well, that is exactly what they are. If you are acquainted with any misogynists, give them this book, they are going to absolutely love it. It's really well written too.<br/>Maybe there was a deeper meaning that was completely lost to me. Maybe, by admitting in the title that the book is actually for misogynists, Highsmith is just trying to make a point. But it doesn't read like that. For now, I'm giving it 1 star.
